I have been with Innovation Foundry for almost two years. In this time I have learned wide range of programming concepts: from the basics of computer science, to creating complex algorithms. I have had a passion for computer technology even before joining Innovation Foundry, and since I have been a part of this organization my passion for this field has grown exponentially. Ever since I was 11 years old I wanted to learn how to code, unfortunately, intro level CS courses were really expensive and free online tutorials weren’t very effective. IF has not only given me the essential tools I needed to learn how to write code, but it has also helped me to get a glimpse of what it’s like to work on a team when creating mobile applications. The hands on learning experience that I gained with IF helped grow my passion for wanting to pursue a career in Computer Science. Thomas Hanks, my mentor/teacher, has done an extraordinary job at guiding me to becoming a better programmer. In addition to our weekly instructional sessions, he has went above and beyond to help ensure that I firmly grasp new material. I recall a time when it was 11 o’clock at night and I was having trouble fixing a bug in my code, once I reached out to Tommy for help, he was quick to respond and lead me in the right direction that same night. He was even willing to Skype that night so that he can thoroughly explain how to approach fixing bugs. This is just one example of how Tommy has shown a sincere interest in helping me progress, and it is one of the main reasons why I have learned so much throughout my time with Innovation Foundry. It is also one of the main reasons why I plan to continue mastering my skills as a programmer through Innovation Foundry as I head off to college this fall, with an intended concentration in CS at Brown University."
