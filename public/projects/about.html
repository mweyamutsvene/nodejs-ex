								<h2>What We Have to Offer</h2>
								<p>Innovation Foundry's has three primary goals: introducing students
									 to coding and careers available in computer science, Mentoring students along the path of
								 software development, and giving practical, pragmatic experience in the field by providing
							 opportunites to program more complex applications and mentor other students.  </p>

									<h3 class="major">Intro To Programming</h3>
									<p>Our top priority bringing awareness to the next generation of young adults that software development is more than an
									abstract concept. We believe that everyone can and should learn the basics of programming; that it is a skill that will
								aid in any profession that they go into. For morst students in highschool and middle school, there is a serious deficit in software development classes.  Either the
								classes are not offered or are not effective in peaking student interest in the field, especially among minority and poorer communities.  </p>

									<p>We provide a programming bootcamp experience taught by successful, experienced software engineers ensuring that important
									concepts are taught and understood by our students.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Mentorship</h3>
									<p>An important factor in the success of our students is strong mentorship from these experienced individuals.  While students
									are learning and growing their skills, they can lean on these individuals for guidance. Having someone our students can directly message
								  provides a significant amount of confidence that leads to exponential growth and success</p>



									<h3 class="major">Pragmatic Experience</h3>
									<p>One thing that is universal in all fields: experience is key to landing a high paying job or being accepted into the best schools
									and programs. We teach our students how to work in corporate environments, how project management is applied, and how to work in teams
									consisting of other developers and designers.  They are encouraged to work on their own applications and can use all resources from
									Innovation foundry to assist in their endeavours.
									</p>
									<p>	 Once our students gain enough knowledge in programming, they are given opportunites to assist in mentoring other students. Volunteering
									builds both character and looks good on both resumes and scholorship applications</p>
